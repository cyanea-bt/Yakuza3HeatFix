Brief overview:
Patch that attempts to fix Heat related issues (draining too early/too fast) in Yakuza 3 Remastered.

Detailed description:
This patch attempts to fix these Heat related issues in [b]Yakuza 3 Remastered[/b]:
[list]
[*]Heat starts to drain too soon after gaining Heat/hitting an enemy
[*]Heat drops too quickly once it starts to drain
[/list]
[b]Y3R's[/b] internal logic runs 60 times per second [b](even if framelimit is set to 30 fps)[/b].
The function that calculates Heat gain/drain is hardcoded assuming 30 updates per second.
That's why the Heat drain starts after half the time it takes on PS3 and also why the drain rate is ~2x of what it is on PS3.

In order to return to PS3-like behavior, this patch limits the Heat function to 30 updates per second.
I also compared the patched Heat drain to the PS3 original and they look pretty much identical.

[b][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/b]
I only tested this patch on the [url=https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/6407476/]most recent version[/url] of Y3R. Other versions might work as well, YMMV.

[b][size=5]Install:[/size][/b]
Mod is now compatible with [url=https://github.com/SRMM-Studio/ShinRyuModManager]ShinRyuModManager[/url], so simply download and install like all other SRMM mods.
[b]Please delete the old version's files before using the new one.[/b]

If you don't want to use [url=https://github.com/SRMM-Studio/ShinRyuModManager]ShinRyuModManager[/url], you can also opt to use any other ASI Loader instead (like the one included with [url=https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatchYRC]SilentPatchYRC[/url]). In that case you should extract [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.asi[/b] to the same directory as [b]Yakuza3.exe AND dinput8.dll[/b]

[size=3][b]Verify that the patch is working as intended (optional):[/b][/size]
1. Start the game after installing/enabling the mod.
2. After you get to the main menu, there should now be a [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.txt[/b] next to [b]Yakuza3.exe[/b].
3. Open this text file and verify that the first 5 lines read:
