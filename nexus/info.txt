Brief overview:
Patch that attempts to fix Heat related issues (draining too early/fast) in Yakuza 3 Remastered.

Detailed description:
This patch attempts to fix these Heat related issues in [b]Yakuza 3 Remastered[/b]:
[list]
[*]Heat starts to drain too soon after gaining Heat/hitting an enemy
[*]Heat drops too quickly once it starts to drain
[/list]
[b]Y3R's[/b] internal logic runs 60 times per second [b](even if framelimit is set to 30 fps)[/b].
The function that calculates Heat gain/drain is hardcoded assuming 30 updates per second.
That's why the Heat drain starts after half the time it takes on PS3 and also why the drain rate is ~2x of what it is on PS3.

In order to return to PS3-like behavior, this patch limits the Heat function to 30 updates per second.
I also compared the patched Heat drain to the PS3 original and they look pretty much identical.

[b][size=5]Compatibility:[/size][/b]
I only tested this patch on the [url=https://steamdb.info/patchnotes/6407476/]most recent version[/url] of Y3R. Other versions might work as well, YMMV.

[b][size=5]Install:[/size][/b]
1. You'll need to set up your copy of [b]Yakuza 3 Remastered[/b] so that it will load [b].asi[/b] files.
If you're using [url=https://github.com/CookiePLMonster/SilentPatchYRC]SilentPatchYRC[/url] and/or a [b]recent[/b] version of [url=https://github.com/SRMM-Studio/ShinRyuModManager]ShinRyuModManager[/url], you are already good to go since both come with the required ASI Loader. Otherwise you'll have to track down a working version here: [url=https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader]Ultimate-ASI-Loader[/url]
2. Download Mod and extract it to your Yakuza 3 directory (don't know if this works with Vortex, so don't ask me).
3. [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.asi[/b] should be in the same directory as [b]Yakuza3.exe AND dinput8.dll.[/b] DON'T put it in your [b]mods[/b] directory!
4. You're done, start the game and enjoy.

[size=3][b]Verify that the patch was installed correctly (optional):[/b][/size]
5. Exit the game after you get to the main menu.
6. Next to [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.asi[/b] there should now be a [b]Yakuza3HeatFix.txt[/b]
7. Open this text file and verify that the first 2 lines read:
